                <p>Restaurant Automation System (RAS) is developed with the intention of automating the day-to-day task in the restaurant like order, inventory management, bill generations, taking feedbacks. The main purpose is to improve the performance of the restaurant by reducing the traditional paper works. With the help of the system works would be performed in less time and more efficiently. This system will be beneficial during rush hours by balancing the load perfectly. The performance of the work will increase with less human error that occurs when performing tasks manually, and the order queue present in the system to assign task to chef will reduce the congestion in the kitchen. Feedback module will help the restaurant to check their performance, and periodical finance report can be generated to see the trend of the profit and sales. Third party payment systems will be used to execute the payment operations.</p>
